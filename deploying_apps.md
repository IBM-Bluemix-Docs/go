# Deploying and integrating Go apps
{: #go-deploy-apps}

You can deploy your Go apps with a toolchain or by using the command-line interface. A toolchain is a set of tool integrations to help build and automate application deployment. To understand more about toolchains and how they work, see [Continuous Delivery](/docs/services/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-getting-started). This topic helps you find useful information on different deployment methodologies for Go applications such as CLI, Kubernetes, containers, VSI, and private cloud.

## Deploying to a Kubernetes cluster
{: #deploy_kube-go}

You can learn how to use {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Kubernetes Service to deploy a containerized Go app. Check out the [tutorial steps](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cluster_tutorial#cs_cluster_tutorial) for more information on setting up a Kubernetes cluster in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.

* [Deploying to IBM Cloud Private with {{site.data.keyword.dev_cli_short}} CLI](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2017/09/deploying-ibm-cloud-private-ibm-cloud-developer-tools-cli/){: new_window} ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon").

## Deploying to container services with the CLI
{: #go-deploy-container}

Use the `ibmcloud dev deploy` command to deploy to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. 

To deploy to IBM Container Services in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, use the following command:
```
ibmcloud dev deploy â€“target container 
```
{: codeblock}

For more information about `ibmcloud dev` commands, see [Developing and deploying your apps](/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-ibmcloud-cli#ibmcloud-cli).

## Deploying to Cloud Foundry
{: #go-deploy-cf}

This option deploys your cloud-native app without you needing to manage the underlying infrastructure.

If you plan to deploy your app to [{{site.data.keyword.cfee_full}}](/docs/cloud-foundry?topic=cloud-foundry-about#about), you must [prepare your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account](/docs/cloud-foundry?topic=cloud-foundry-prepare#prepare).

If your account has access to {{site.data.keyword.cfee_full_notm}}, you can select a deployer type of either **[Public Cloud](/docs/cloud-foundry-public?topic=cloud-foundry-public-about-cf#about-cf)** or **[Enterprise Environment](/docs/cloud-foundry-public?topic=cloud-foundry-public-cfee#cfee)**, which you can use to create and manage isolated environments for hosting Cloud Foundry applications exclusively for your enterprise.

## Deploying to a virtual server
{: #go-vsi-deploy}

Deploy {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} App Service apps into virtual server instances to enable your platform and infrastructure developer activities to work together and increase app control and flexibility.

A virtual server instance offers better transparency, predictability, and automation for all workload types when compared to other configurations. Combine it with a bare metal server to create unique workload combinations. For example, you can create high-performance database logic or machine learning with bare metal and GPU configurations that run a Debian Linux-based operating system.

For more information, see [Deploying to a virtual server](/docs/apps?topic=creating-apps-vsi-deploy#vsi-deploy).
