# Getting Go support

You can quickly get help with your Go application by asking questions on dWanswers, engaging official IBM Support for Runtimes, or checking the buildpack runtime support documentation.

## Asking for help on dWanswers

Ask questions on [dWAnswers](https://developer.ibm.com/answers/topics/golang.html) by using the `#golang` tag.

## Using official IBM Support for Runtimes

IBM Foundation Support for Runtimes provides coverage for Node.js, Swift, Java, and Go. Support is available for Go 1.10 from the [golang.org](https://golang.org/) community, including the IBM Watson SDK for Go. 

The Go runtime support is available for any modules that you're using within your application. Support is available for wherever you want to deploy the runtime, whether thatâ€™s on your own computers, in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, or elsewhere.

To learn more, visit [IBM Digital Marketplace](https://www.ibm.com/us-en/marketplace/support-for-runtimes).

## Buildpack Support Statement

Issues can be reported against any version of the built-in IBM buildpack currently supported on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, however, they must be verified against the latest version. If a defect is found, IBM will provide a fix in a future level of the runtime and corresponding buildpack. For more information, see the [buildpack support statement](../runtimes/common/buildpackSupport.html).
